# Welcome to MapRefuge!üó∫Ô∏èüìå

MapRefuge is a **web-based application** designed to provide refugees, asylees, parolees, and other vulnerable individuals with **a secure, privacy-focused platform to locate essential resources**. With curated data and an intuitive map interface, MapRefuge helps users **find legal services, healthcare, housing, employment, and more, without tracking their personal information**.

Built on a foundation of privacy, MapRefuge leverages **Cloudflare**‚Äôs protection to ensure all user interactions are untrackable, and **Google Maps** integration allows users to locate nearby resources by type and specific accessibility needs.

## Main Features

-   **Privacy-First Design**: No tracking of user location or IP. Cloudflare shields user data, and the site operates without location-based requests.
-   **Resource Mapping**: Displays hard-coded resources from a CSV file, avoiding real-time tracking.
-   **Google Maps Integration**: Interactive map for viewing nearby essential services and resources.
-   **Filter and Search**: Allows users to filter resources based on accessibility, affordability, and type of service.
-   **User-Contributed Tags and Ratings**: Users can add relevant tags (e.g., LGBTQ+ friendly, wheelchair accessible) to improve information accuracy.
-   **Detailed Resource Information**: Provides basic details, ratings, and reviews for each location.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**üåç: Imports resource data from a CSV file and renders markers on the map.
-   **Frontend**üåé: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a Google Maps interface with customized markers.
-   **Data Privacy**üåè: Cloudflare‚Äôs SSL/TLS and IP masking features ensure user privacy, masking location and IP details.
