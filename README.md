# Welcome to MapRefuge!üó∫Ô∏èüìå

  

MapRefuge is a **web-based application** designed to provide refugees, asylees, parolees, and other vulnerable individuals with **a secure, privacy-focused platform to locate essential resources**. With curated data and an intuitive map interface, MapRefuge helps users **find legal services, healthcare, housing, employment, and more, without tracking their personal information**.

  

Built on a foundation of privacy, MapRefuge leverages **Cloudflare**‚Äôs protection to ensure all user interactions are untrackable, and **Google Maps** integration allows users to locate nearby resources by type and specific accessibility needs.

  

## Main Features

  

-  **Privacy-First Design**: No tracking of user location or IP. Cloudflare shields user data, and the site operates without location-based requests.

-  **Resource Mapping**: Displays hard-coded resources from a CSV file, avoiding real-time tracking.

-  **Google Maps Integration**: Interactive map for viewing nearby essential services and resources.

-  **Filter and Search**: Allows users to filter resources based on accessibility, affordability, and type of service.

-  **User-Contributed Tags and Ratings**: Users can add relevant tags (e.g., LGBTQ+ friendly, wheelchair accessible) to improve information accuracy.

-  **Detailed Resource Information**: Provides basic details, ratings, and reviews for each location.

  

## Project Structure

  

-  **Backend**üåç: Imports resource data from a CSV file and renders markers on the map.

-  **Frontend**üåé: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a Google Maps interface with customized markers.

-  **Data Privacy**üåè: Cloudflare‚Äôs SSL/TLS and IP masking features ensure user privacy, masking location and IP details.

  
  

## Getting Started

  To view MapRefuge, just got to:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MapRefuge.git

```

To get started with MapRefuge on your local machine, allowing you to update the included services included on the map:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MapRefuge.git

```

2.  **Set up Cloudflare**:

- Ensure the domain is linked with Cloudflare and SSL/TLS is set to **Full (Strict)** for secure end-to-end encryption.

  

3.  **Integrate Google Maps API**:

- Get an API key from the [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/), create a file named **.env.local** in the my-app folder, and insert the code below where TEMP_API_KEY is the API key drawn from the Google Maps Platform. 

> NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=TEMP_API_KEY

4.  **Prepare Resource Data**:

- Place your updated CSV file (`normalized_services.csv`) found within the my-app/src/app/Data_Resources folder. 
- You can either update it directly from the file given, or upload the normalized_services.csv file to Google Sheets or Excel, and update it there! 

  

5.  **Launch the Application**:

-  Change the directory to my-app (cd into my-app).
-  For the first time running MapRefuge, run **npm run build** in the terminal.
- For all further runs, use **npm run dev**.
